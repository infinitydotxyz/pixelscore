# this script:
# 0. Needs chainId and collection address as args
# 1. Copies images from gcs to local filesystem
# 2. Resizes them using imagemagick's mogrify to 224x224 (separate folder)
#       by maintaining the aspect ratio and crops so thereâ€™s nothing overlapping

# read args
chainId=$1
collectionAddress=$2

# cd to the right dir
cd /mnt/disks/ssd/data

# mkdirs
mkdir -p $collectionAddress/orig
mkdir -p $collectionAddress/resized

# copy files from gcs (multi-threaded) into <collectionAddress>/orig dir
gsutil -m cp gs://infinity-static/images/$chainId/collections/$collectionAddress/* $collectionAddress/orig

# resize and save to resized folder
mogrify -path $collectionAddress/resized -resize 224x224^ -gravity center -extent 224x224 $collectionAddress/orig/*
